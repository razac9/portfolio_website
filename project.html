            <p>HealthUpLift | August 2023</p>
            <p>• Fitness webpage w/ login & signup that recommends daily exercises & meals based on user’s goals (Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, ZenQuotes API, and Spoonacular API)</p>

            <p>Housing & Innovatio in Revit | November 2023</p>
            <p>• Created a Revit design of NYU's Jacob Academic Building</p>
            <p>• The completed redesign of the building had six floors. The dimensions of the building were 200 feet by 200 feet. For educational spaces, the building includes ten 40-student classrooms, eight 20-student classrooms, and two 100-student lecture halls. The design also includes a recreational space, dorms to accommodate 100 students, and one facility of choice. The facility of choice was decided upon to be a food court. The cost of operation was minimized for the project.</p>
            <p>• The design achieved a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) accreditation of Platinum by meeting the requirements for six categories. The building adhered to fire codes, wheelchair accessibility guidelines, security requirements, and structural rules set forth by the General Engineering Building Code. Fire Codes required overhead sprinklers and emergency evacuation stairs on each floor, and fire alarms in each room. Wheelchair accessibility guidelines required 6 feet wide walkways and at least one bathroom stall per floor that is wheelchair accessible. For security requirements, a tap-in ID system accompanies 24/7 security guard desks, and dorms have turnstiles with a security guard. Doors of the building are 6 feet and 8 inches tall and 3 feet wide, and walls must be at least 8 feet tall.</p>
